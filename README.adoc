== relaydoors
_Like relayd, but with doors._

`relaydoors` is an avant-garde application server inspired by OpenBSD's
https://github.com/openbsd/src/usr.sbin/relayd[`relayd`] and heirloom UNIX `inetd`. It listens for
an incoming networking connection, forwarding the session socket descriptor over an
https://github.com/robertdfrench/revolving-door[illumos door] to the intended application.
`relaydoors` maps each connected port to a door on the filesystem provided by the target
application.

.Startup and Request Handling

One goal of `relaydoors` is to facilitate the scaling of single-threaded applications. Under the
`inetd` model, a new process is created to handle every request. By leveraging doors, `relaydoors`
can create a new thread in the application process only when a new highwater mark of concurrency has
been reached; otherwise, existing threads will be re-used to handle subsequent requests.
