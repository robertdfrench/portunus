== Security Policy

`portnus` does not even work right now, so there are no supported versions.
Until the project is stabilized, security problems can be reported as issues.
If it is ever stabilized, I would prefer securiy disclosures be made via PGP
encrypted email.

Security issues will always receive top priority.
