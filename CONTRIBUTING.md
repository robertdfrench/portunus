### Add Your Copyright Notice
Your PR should include an appropriate copyright notice on any file that you
modify. If it is your first time updating a file, add your copyright to the
bottom of the list. If you have updated a file previously, make sure the year is
current.

For example, if your name is "Portunus D. Crab" and the year is 2030, you would
add your copyright notice like so:

```rust
/* 
 * This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
 * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
 * file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
 *
 * Copyright 2021 Robert D. French
 * Copyright 2030 Portunus D. Crab
 */
```


### Add the Best Documentation you can Muster
The PortunusD source code is documented according to the 17th Edition of the
Chicago Manual of Style (as best it can be stretched to apply to this kind of
writing). If writing is not your strong suit, no worries! Give it your best
shot and we'll be happy to work out the differences during code review.


### Read and Follow the Code of Conduct
It's the same [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that
GitHub encourages for new projects.
