### Add Your Copyright Notice
Your PR should include an appropriate copyright notice on any file that you
modify. If it is your first time updating a file, add your copyright to the
bottom of the list. If you have updated a file previously, make sure the year is
current.

For example, if your name is "Marsha P. Johnson" and the year is 2030, you would
add your copyright notice like so:

```rust
/* 
 * This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
 * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
 * file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

 * Copyright 2021 Robert D. French
 * Copyright 2030 Marsha P. Johnson
 */
```

### Add the Best Documentation you can Muster
The Portunus source code is documented in American English, with an attempt to
use the 17th Edition of the Chicago Manual of Style (as best it can be stretched
to apply to this kind of writing). If English is not your first language, or if
writing is not your greatest passion, *I would be glad to help you*.

It's okay if your writing is imperfect, but it's not okay to expect the code to 
document itself.

### Follow the Code of Conduct
It's the same [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that
GitHub encourages for new projects.
