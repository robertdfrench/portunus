## Security Policy

Please disclose security problems by:

1. Opening a tracking issue in GitHub with a random, nondescript title.
1. Sending the content of the disclosure via email to
   portunusd@protonmail.com, using the above issue title as the subject.

I will ask for 30-90 days (depending on the complexity of the issue) to create a
bugfix before you disclose your findings; the tracking issue will help you keep
me publicly accountable.

Portunus has no users and therefore no money for bounties, but I will be
delighted to "retweet" your writeup in order to draw attention to your hard
work.
