## PortunusD Artwork
This directory contains artwork used to promote the PortunusD software
project. 


### Inspiration
The PortunusD software is named after the ancient Roman [god of doors and
ports][1], who was often depicted (like [Janus][2]) as having two faces on
opposite sides of a structure.

There is also a [genus of crab][3], with the blue [*Portunus armatus*][4]
species serving as the official mascot, to distinguish it from [Ferris][5].


### Licensing
The blue crab images in this directory are not relicensable, so if you fork the
project, you will need to either find a different logo or purchase a new license
from the [Noun Project][6].
