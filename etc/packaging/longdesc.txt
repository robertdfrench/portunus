PortunusD is a network application server inspired by OpenBSD's relayd and
heirloom UNIX inetd. It listens for an incoming network connection, forwarding
the incoming data over an illumos door to the intended application, and
returning the response in a similar manner. PortunusD maps each connected port
to a door on the filesystem provided by the target application.
